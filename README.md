# Aurora Discord Bot

*A community-built Discord bot to provide services in the Minecraft Computer Mods Discord guild.*

# Development

This Discord bot is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) 
framework.

## Repository folder structure

The following folder structure is expected:
- `assets/` - Contains all the assets such as the logo and other media used for the bot.
- `src/modules/` - Contains all the logic the bot uses such as events and slash-commands, with each file containing 
  separate functionality.
- `src/modules.ts` - Index of all the modules under `src/modules/`, which is code-generated by `pnpm lint:codegen`.
- `src/index.ts` - The main file for the bot, which is run to start the bot.
- `tools/` - Contains build scripts for development.

## Required software

- You will need **node.js** and **npm**. For a POSIX-compliant environment, I recommend 
  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install these, if you do not have them already installed.
- A modern IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended as well.

## Setting up

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the root directory of the repository, and use `pnpm install` to install the required dependencies 
  automatically.
- Create a Discord application (bot instance) at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
- Invite your bot to a test-guild, and be sure to give the bot the correct scopes and permissions, for example with the 
  following url: `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE&permissions=1505587489862&scope=bot%20applications.commands`
- Copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the correct values:
  - `ENABLED_MODULES` should contain the names of the modules you want to enable, separated by commas.
  - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` should be the private token of the bot instance you created.
  - `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` should be the guild id of the guild you want to use the bot in.

## Running

You can start the bot by executing `pnpm dev` in the root directory of the repository. The bot should appear online in
Discord shortly, and you can try to use it by typing the `/ping` command.

### Docker

The bot ships with a Dockerfile, which you can build directly with `docker build . -t aurorabot`, or in Docker Compose
with the following:

```yml
services:
  aurorabot:
    build: .
    restart: always
    environment:
      - ENABLED_MODULES=ForumPinner,Info,Ping,System
      - DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
      - DISCORD_GUILD_ID=${DISCORD_GUILD_ID}
```

## TL;DR

```sh
pnpm install # Install dependencies
cp .env.example .env # Setup environment variables
pnpm dev # Start the bot
```

Do you want to implement a new feature or change an existing feature? To ensure we'll accept and merge your work, please
discuss the changes first in the Discord guild. Ask your fellow community members and/or staff members what they think
about your proposed modifications in the `#bot` and/or `#meta` channels. Major changes or new features might require

Naturally, all features in the Discord bot must not violate to the Discord terms of service for bots. To ensure this,
the bot should not persistently store any user data gathered from Discord.
